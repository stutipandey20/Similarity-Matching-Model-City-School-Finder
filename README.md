# Similarity Matching Model for City School Finder


## Problem Statement

Develop a model to help parents identify the top five schools in a given city that are most comparable to a specific school. The model uses relevant school traits and performance indicators to provide insightful information, facilitating informed decisions about children's education.


## Data Mining Task: Similarity Matching

The model compares various features of schools, such as academic performance, facilities, and extracurricular activities, to find similar schools within a city. Techniques like cosine similarity and Euclidean distance are used to enhance school selection by providing personalized recommendations.

## Benefits
Improved Comparison: Provides a comprehensive understanding of schools beyond simple rankings.
Finding the Right Fit: Identifies schools that align with a child's unique needs and learning style.
Reduced Search Time: Streamlines the school selection process, saving time and effort.
Data-Driven Decisions: Enhances the accuracy and reliability of school recommendations.
